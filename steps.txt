Steps to run the Automated Scoring Tool:
Install dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt 
Prepare your transcript JSON with "text" and "metadata" (word_count).
Run the scorer: python compliant_scorer.py (modify example_text or call evaluate()).
Review the printed report and final score (out of 100).
Optional: edit CSV_RUBRIC in compliant_scorer.py or integrate evaluate() into other apps.
